# Testimonial

I am creating this Testimonials Template as a modal. I hope to have the Testimonials Form and display in the same Element.
It is based on the Card Design, with a Page Flip addition. The Testimonial will take input and add it to a database table called "testimonials",
and after the testimonial is submitted it can be added to the databse table and displayed immediately or have a hidden input for authorization of the testimonial to be displayed. The Hidden Authorization Input will be included in the Testimonial Template nut not active.
